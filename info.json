  "description": "This mod adds byproducts to common recipies, and useful ways to process those byproducts.\nThe intent of this mod is to add additional byproduct outputs to recipes, to provide opportunities to make more interesting designs that sort through outputs or use the circuit system. One of my greatest criticisms of the base game are that the base recipe outputs are too simple, so there is seldom reason to sort, filter, or use circuits. Other mods that address this deviate far from base gameplay, and complicate the game to a high degree. This mod seeks to be a solution to this while still being close to vanilla.\nEach byproduct is toggleable in the mod settings menu, to customize your experience or to allow for further support for other mods.\nThis mod has been designed in such a way to be extremely compatible with other mods. Recipes are never overwritten, but the byproducts are added intelligently to the outputs.\nIncludes : \n\tSlag : byproduct of smelting, can be turned into bricks or searched for trace minerals\n\tPlastic Waste : byproduct of certain plastic recipes, can be smelted down into plastic or can undergo pyrolysis to create pyrolysis oil, which is a potent fluid for flame turrets that can also be turned into fuel\n\tSpent Etchant, a byproduct of electronics production, which can be used to reclaim copper from these recipes\n\tCopper Sulfate : byproduct of advanced electronics recipes, it can be decomposed into copper and sulfur, turned into explosives, or turned into lubricant\n\tPlutonium : a byproduct of nuclear fuel recycling, it can be used to make long lasting fuel.\nThis mod also adds an early game filter inserter, to help deal with slag before splitters are unlocked. This can also be toggled in the mod settings."
