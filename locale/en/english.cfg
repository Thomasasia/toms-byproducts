[item-description]
tbp-slag=A Waste byproduct from the smelting of ores. Can be turned into bricks or scoured for trace minerals.
tbp-spent-etchant=Can be processed into copper or copper wires.
tbp-plastic-waste=Trimmings, warped product, and vestiges of plastic processing. Useless in its current form, it can be turned into plastic, or turned into fuel via pyrolysis.
tbp-solid-pyrolysis-oil=Pyrolysis Oil made solid, an excellent yet polluting fuel source.
tbp-copper-sulfate=Can be processed into the constituent copper and sulfur, or used to make industrial lube or high explosives.
