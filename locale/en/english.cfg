[item-description]
tbp-slag=A Waste byproduct from the smelting of ores. Can be turned into bricks or scoured for trace minerals.
tbp-spent-etchant=Can be processed into copper or copper wires.
tbp-plastic-waste=Trimmings, warped product, and vestiges of plastic processing. Useless in its current form, it can be turned into plastic, or turned into fuel via pyrolysis.
tbp-solid-pyrolysis-oil=Pyrolysis Oil made solid, an excellent yet polluting fuel source.
tbp-copper-sulfate=Can be processed into the constituent copper and sulfur, or used to make industrial lube or high explosives.
tbp-picky-inserter=This inserter has a single item filter, is as slow as a standard inserter, and is fairly inefficient. However, it can also be crafted from the start of the game.

[mod-setting-name]
tbp-enable-slag=Enable slag
tbp-enable-spent-etchant=Enable spent etchant
tbp-enable-plastic-waste=Enable plastic waste
tbp-enable-copper-sulfate=Enable copper sulfate
tbp-enable-petroleum-sludge=Enable petroleum sludge
tbp-enable-ash-sludge=Enable ash sludge
tbp-enable-plutonium=Enable plutonium
tbp-early-game-filter-inserter=Enable early game filter inserter (aka the picky inserter)

[mod-setting-description]
tbp-enable-slag=Enables slag, a byproduct of smelting. Makes the early game more challenging, and more rewarding.
tbp-enable-spent-etchant=Enables spent etchant, a byproduct of electronics production. 
tbp-enable-plastic-waste=Enables plastic waste, and pyrolysis oil. A number of useful things can be created from this.
tbp-enable-copper-sulfate=Enables copper sulfate, a byproduct of advanced electronics production. Can be combined with other byproducts to make useful things.
tbp-enable-petroleum-sludge=Enable petroleum sludge, a byproduct of a small number of petroleum and oil recipes. Can be recycled or turned into other things.
tbp-enable-ash-sludge=Enables burning coal down to ash sludge, and scouring ash sludge for trace minerals. This is how North Korea gets its uranium.
tbp-enable-plutonium=Enables plutonium, a byproduct of nuclear fuel reprocessing. Can be used to make powerful fuel sources.
tbp-early-game-filter-inserter=Allows the use of a low grade early game filter inserter, to allow for sorting before splitters are unlocked. This can be important in order to deal with slag in the early game.
