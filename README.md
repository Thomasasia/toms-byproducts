# toms-byproducts
This mod adds byproducts to common recipes and useful ways to process those byproducts.

The intent of this mod is to add additional byproduct outputs to recipes, providing opportunities to create more interesting designs that sort through outputs or use the circuit system. One of my greatest criticisms of the base game is that the recipe outputs are too simple, leading to little reason to sort, filter, or use circuits. Other mods addressing this tend to deviate far from the base gameplay and complicate the game significantly. This mod aims to be a solution to this while staying close to vanilla.

Each byproduct is toggleable in the mod settings menu to customize your experience or allow for further support for other mods.

This mod has been designed to be extremely compatible with other mods. Recipes are never overwritten, and the byproducts are added intelligently to the outputs.

Includes:
    - Slag: byproduct of smelting, can be turned into bricks or searched for trace minerals
    - Plastic Waste: byproduct of certain plastic recipes, can be smelted down into plastic or undergo pyrolysis to create pyrolysis oil, a potent fluid for flame turrets that can also be turned into fuel
    - Spent Etchant: a byproduct of electronics production, which can be used to reclaim copper from these recipes
    - Copper Sulfate: byproduct of advanced electronics recipes, can be decomposed into copper and sulfur, turned into explosives, or turned into lubricant
    - Plutonium: a byproduct of nuclear fuel recycling, can be used to make long-lasting fuel.

This mod also adds an early game filter inserter to help deal with slag before splitters are unlocked. This can also be toggled in the mod settings.

I also recommend [the side inserters mod, if you want to put different byproducts on different parts of belts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Side%20Inserters) and the [flare stack mod to destroy unwanted byproducts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flare%20Stack). The game is perfectly functional without these who, and I used neither during testing and balancing. But you may still find them convenient!

If you have any suggestions for new recipes, byproducts, or balance changes, please add an issue to the Github page, or make a pull request if you feel ambitious.
